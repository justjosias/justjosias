### Greetings and Salutations

I am currently working on [Heb12](https://heb12.com) as a free and open source Bible system.

Other places to find my code:
- [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Josias) (main)
- [git.josias.dev](https://git.josias.dev) (secondary)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/justjosias) (contributing only)

I try to avoid GitHub for my personal projects. See my profile at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Josias) for lots of (hopefully) useful code. Software freedom requires autonomy over the software your project relies upon. GitHub is not necessary for collaboration (especially now).

### Copilot

GitHub has been training their Copilot AI on GitHub repositories, but has not given developers credit for this work nor have otherwise followed the licenses of the software they used. 

Apparently this is built into their Terms of Service. We've been unintentionally giving them permissing to use our code for this without informed consent. This cannot be avoided except by hosting code in a place that respects developers better than Microsoft. 

In short: host your code elsewhere if you have a respect for Software Freedom and don't want your free code to be used to train someone else's proprietary AI.

I highly recommend [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org), but just choose some place, whether it be Codeberg, GitLab, or your own cgit server running in your basement.
