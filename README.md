### Greetings and Salutations

I am currently working on [Heb12](https://heb12.com) as a free and open source Bible system and other various projects.

I'm a fan of [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig). 

Also see [my GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/justjosias).

I try to avoid GitHub for my personal projects. See my profile at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Josias) for lots of (hopefully) useful code. Software freedom requires autonomy over the software your project relies upon. GitHub is not necessary for collaboration (especially now).
