### Greetings and Salutations

I have been working on [Cooperative Technology](https://cooperativetechnology.codeberg.page/), especially related to [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/).

Other places to find my code:
- [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Josias) (main)
- [git.josias.dev](https://git.josias.dev) (secondary)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/justjosias) (contributing only)

I try to avoid GitHub for my personal projects. See my profile at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Josias) for lots of (hopefully) useful code. Software freedom requires autonomy over the software your project relies upon. GitHub is not necessary for collaboration (especially now).
