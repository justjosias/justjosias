### Greetings and Salutations

I am currently working on [Heb12](https://heb12.com) as a free and open source Bible system.

You also might want to check out [jw, a micro-journaling tool](https://github.com/justjosias/jw) I've been working on.

Languages I mostly use:
- C
- Go
- [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig).
- Rust
- Python

Other places to find my code:
- [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Josias) (main)
- [git.josias.dev](https://git.josias.dev) (secondary)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/justjosias) (contributing only)

I try to avoid GitHub for my personal projects. See my profile at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Josias) for lots of (hopefully) useful code. Software freedom requires autonomy over the software your project relies upon. GitHub is not necessary for collaboration (especially now).
